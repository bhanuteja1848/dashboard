8,IL,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,The worst customer service & quality,"Ordered the Yris dress in white.

I then received a gift card from them when I returned it, despite choosing ‚Äúrefund back to original payment method‚Äù when creating the return. I contacted them, and was told that ‚ÄúFC‚Äù on the product name meant final call which means no refund given, only gift card. They expect their customers to know that the abbreviation meant that. I asked them to show in my account original order email confirmation, where it says that it was final call, and they weren‚Äôt able to show this to me, just keep highlighting the ‚ÄúFC‚Äù on their website. I‚Äôm not sure why I ordered from them, as I‚Äôve ordered a total of 3 times now and have always had to return due to poor manufacturing or material. It is convenient that a dress which shows your full seamless underwear, is under ‚ÄúFC‚Äù meaning customers will never be reimbursed. Their customer service advisor was also very patronising and rude in his last email; he could not show me the terms and conditions in my screenshot I sent of my original email, but kept advising me I ‚Äúclearly‚Äù agreed to this by checking out.","June 03, 2025",1.0,"The worst customer service & quality Ordered the Yris dress in white.

18,Customer,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Unwearable dress, rejected return, poor customer service","
I bought the ARIA Maxi Dress in a size 12. It went on easily but was impossible to take off without help. The poor construction means the dress can‚Äôt be removed without placing it under stress. I wasn‚Äôt wearing makeup, tan, or body products, and filmed the struggle to remove it.

Wander Doll refused my return, citing ‚Äúmarks‚Äù on the satin ‚Äî but the photos they provided show normal creases and folds, not product transfer or damage. Satin is known to mark easily under pressure, and the fabric used offers no tolerance for standard trying-on.

The size 12 is also labelled ‚Äúlarge‚Äù but fits more like a 10. I‚Äôm a true 12 and rarely have sizing issues.

Trying something on to assess fit is a legal right. If a dress becomes unsellable from being tried on once, it‚Äôs not fit for purpose. I‚Äôve escalated this with Klarna and Trading Standards and would advise others to be cautious before buying.","May 22, 2025",1.0,"Unwearable dress, rejected return, poor customer service

80,D R,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,SCAM!,"

If I could, I would give ZERO. Please read all the reviews, their return policy is a SCAM. First of all, my order arrived LATE. Only after chasing them for my original delivery, they said the items were out of stock at time of purchase therefore they went into back order to be shipped 2 weeks later - please note there was NO mention of this at all at time of purchase nor on the order confirmation! When asking to cancel the back order they REFUSED to do so. I should have known then that I was in for a scam! Because WHY are you confirming my order if the stock is not there? Anyway, it should be easy enough to cancel a back order, since the item was unavailable therefore not allocated yet. But they said NO.
When I finally got my order (for a total of 4 items), I opened 2 (I repeat, TWO) of the packages to have an idea of the sizing and quality of the fabric. The 2 items were NOT tried on and put back into original poly bags straight away, since no longer needed (arrived late for my event, as per above!). All 4 items, 2 of which weren‚Äôt even opened AT ALL, were sent back as an approved return. I then get an email saying my return was received, but cannot be accepted and I won‚Äôt get my refund, due to ALL garments having a strong SCENT upon inspection. This is clearly an excuse, since only 2 out of 4 items were ever out of the package, in a CLEAN home, for no longer than 1 minute! When I replied saying I was offended by their statement, extremely disappointed in their service AND asked to escalate and to clarify what type of scent they were referring to, I was told by one customer service manager that they are ‚Äúnot specific when describing scents‚Äù (???) and that no, they won‚Äôt accept my return, as due to this scent none of the garments is in re sellable condition, despite UNWORN, with all tags and ribbons.
I find this outrageous.

However, the only thing I cannot get over is the sizing. I am a Size 8 and therefore would order a Small of this Website. I now own 3 items, a corset size small, a skirt size small and a knitted dress size medium.

The corset and skirt is the matching denim coord... well it may as well be made for someone who is a size 4. These items are not true to size.

The brown knitted dress, I chose to get this in a Medium as clearly the sizes come up a lot smaller. this was also extremely tight and I'd say was to fit more of a size 6. it could also do with a couple of inches added to the bottom.

Usually things like this wouldn't bother me, but, the sizing of this clothing has knocked my confidence massively and I'm sure others would've had the same problem.

I spent ¬£140 on a set and paid for 3-4 working days, it's now been 2 weeks and nothing. I spoke to royal mail and they told me they haven't received anything from them. Customer service is awful, I've asked for a refund every day via email and they made an excuse and put the blame elsewhere. I have now had to contact my bank and trading standards. I will continue to trash their social media until they get this website taken down. With just having my third child I really needed this money and there are people like this out there scamming people. So I will not stop until I receive my money and their website taken down.

141,Natasha,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,AVOID AT ALL COST,"I recently purchased a lace bodysuit and matching skirt. It was delivered Friday afternoon, I tried the items on Friday evening after returning home from work then submitted the return the same evening- mostly down to the sizing, ordered XL and the bodysuit would barely go up my arms! I‚Äôm a size 12 for reference. The quality wasn‚Äôt the best. The lace was of poor quality, was on par with SHEIN.

The bodysuit was alone was ¬£43! I‚Äôm not the sort of person to spend this sort of money on an item such as a bodysuit but was hoping to wear it to my works Christmas party.

The bodysuit had a hygiene sticker on it. There was no way you could try it on without removing the hygiene sticker.

Fast forward to today, I have receive an email to say they won‚Äôt be refunding me due to removing the hygiene sticker, pet hairs on the items and a scent to it.

I‚Äôm beyond shocked! I literally had the item on for about 2 minutes maximum. More shocked they‚Äôre saying there is a scent to the item and pet hair. The items were returned in perfect condition with all the tags they came with.

This was my first order with Wanderdoll and it will be my last.

If I do not receive a refund, I will speak to trading standards regarding this.

In reply to their response. The website doesn‚Äôt state ANYTHING AT ALL about no refunds on bodysuits without hygiene stickers. And the pet hair and scent you‚Äôre talking about is non existent!!!! I received the items back yesterday and they‚Äôre in perfect condition!!! I‚Äôve literally got the item in front of my eyes and there is nothing wrong with it! It‚Äôs like your making me out to be a lying! I think your returns team are blind. Funny thing is, you accepted the skirt back and out of the two products, if there were pet hair on anything, it would be on skirt where it‚Äôs touched the floor when trying on. You‚Äôre a bunch of scammers just trying to grab any penny you can from customers.","November 07, 2024",1.0,"AVOID AT ALL COST I recently purchased a lace bodysuit and matching skirt.

144,Vita Siniauskaite,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,One big disappointment - just avoid!,"Customer service is on the new level of rudeness. I have received a damaged item and when I returned it they refused to refund blaming me for the damage.
Funny part, they send the item back to address I don't live anymore. So if there are any problems with the item you receive, customer service will show very little interest and avoid to refund as much as they can. As they are small retailer and goods made from cheap materials, don't expect much. I will avoid this company and that is my advice for all the girls. There are plenty better quality retailers in this country.
Update. I was not refunded nor I got the item they had to send me. The customer service is totally useless and clueless or just playing games. I personally think it's unethical business. Hope, that the bank and authorities will help to sort this out.
